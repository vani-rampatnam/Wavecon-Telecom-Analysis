📶 Wavecon Telecom Analysis 
👩‍💻 About the Project

This project analyzes the performance of Wavecon Telecom before and after the 5G launch, focusing on market share, revenue, and subscription plans. The goal was to measure the business impact of 5G adoption and recommend strategies for sustainable growth.

As the Data Analyst, I was responsible for:

Collecting, cleaning, and preparing data.

Identifying underperforming subscription plans and analyzing market share trends.

Providing business recommendations to stakeholders.

🔍 Problem Statement

After the 5G launch, Wavecon’s market share dropped from 19% to 17%, and some subscription plans showed revenue decline. The business needed insights into:

How to recover lost market share and revenue?
